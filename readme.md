# Project description [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crisfervil/Jigsaw.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crisfervil/Jigsaw) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/crisfervil/Jigsaw/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/crisfervil/Jigsaw?branch=master)
Extensible [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) framework to build any type of applications.

The main difference with others DSL frameworks is that this is an **Extensible** DSL.

# How to start
The best way to start working with Jigsaw is installing a module that contains a language definition and start playing around.

Install for example the [MEAN module](https://github.com/crisfervil/Jigsaw-mean), that allows you to create a MEAN stack based application.

First, create a directory to store your application and cd into it
```
$ mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```
Install Jigsaw
```
$ npm install -g jigs
```
Install the MEAN module. This will install also the required components.
```
$ npm install jigsaw-mean --save
```
Build components
```
$ jigs build
```
Then start the application
```
$ npm start
```
