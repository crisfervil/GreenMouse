# Project description
Extensible [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) framework to build any type of applications.

The main difference with others DSL frameworks is that this is an **Extensible** DSL.

# How to start
The best way to start working with Jigsaw is installing a module that contains a language definition and start playing around.

Install for example the [mean](https://github.com/crisfervil/Jigsaw-mean) module, that allows you to create a MEAN based application.

First, create a directory to store your application
```
$ mkdir myapp
```

Then cd into it
```
$ cd myapp
```

Install Jigsaw
```
$ npm install -g jigs
```

Install the mean package. This will install also the required components.
```
$ jigs install jigsaw-mean
```
Then start the application
```
$ jigs start
```
